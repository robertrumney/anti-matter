## Info
This project was undertaken as a self-imposed challenge to not only test my skills in C++ and Unreal Engine but also test drive the latest UE5.2 which I downloaded minutes before starting the excercise, with a dedicated focus to not use blueprints, plugins or any marketplace assets. The only models and materials used were starter content and royalty free models from SketchFab which I have included with all credits to each artist. All code created within the 48-hour period and is contained within the "code" folder. 

For the purpose of explaining this excercise, each class in the project has its own dedicated folder, housing its respective .cpp and .h files along with a unique README to describe its role and relationships within the greater project.

## Game Overview

Anti-Matter is a first-person horror game which plunges the player into the role of a scientist waking up in a decimated laboratory. With his partner tragically dead and a monstrous creation of a twisted experiment on the loose, the player must navigate the perils of the damaged laboratory.

The game features monologue voice overs, an atmospheric music score, and carefully designed audio to enhance the immersive experience. The first-person player controller, rather than relying on pre-existing templates, was crafted entirely from scratch in C++, including elements such as camera movement, head bobbing, sprinting, and a simple inventory system for items like flashlights.

Within the initial 8 hours of the game jam, the basic structure of the game including the bespoke first-person controller was established. Following this, basic A.I. functionality was added along with environmental effects. A particularly noteworthy achievement during this period was the creation of a special level designer which allowed for the efficient programming of cinematic sound effects and events through asynchronous delays.

## Code Overview

The codebase for Anti-Matter is divided into specific folders, each representing a class within the project. Each folder contains the .cpp and .h files for that class, and a README explaining the class's purpose, main methods, and interactions with other classes. This structure aims to foster an environment of readability and ease of navigation.

While this project stands as a testament to what can be achieved during a game jam, it's important to remember that speed sometimes makes it difficult to adhere to best coding practices. Nevertheless, every effort has been made to maintain clean, efficient, and well-documented code as best as possible.
