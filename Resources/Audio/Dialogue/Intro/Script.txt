INT. CORNISH LABORATORY - DAY

The laboratory is a bustling hive of scientific activity. The room is filled with advanced equipment, blinking monitors, and shelves lined with beakers and test tubes. Four scientists in lab coats, including the PLAYER, are working diligently on a large, complex antimatter machine at the center of the room. The atmosphere is one of excitement mixed with cautious anticipation.

SCIENTIST 1, an enthusiastic researcher, adjusts the dials on the machine with a determined expression.

SCIENTIST 2, an experienced scientist, examines the readings on a monitor, furrowing their brow.

SCIENTIST 3, a quirky and absent-minded individual, scribbles notes in a worn-out notebook, occasionally glancing at the others.

SCIENTIST 4 (PLAYER), a focused and dedicated scientist, carefully operates the control panel of the antimatter machine. They wear an expression of cautious curiosity.

The room hums with the energy of anticipation.

PLAYER
(voiceover)
We had spent countless hours perfecting the design of the antimatter machine. The potential was immense, but so were the risks.

SCIENTIST 1
(excitedly)
We're on the brink of a scientific breakthrough! Imagine the possibilities!

SCIENTIST 2
(cautioning)
Remember, we must proceed with utmost care. Antimatter is not to be underestimated.

SCIENTIST 3
(distractedly)
Did I remember to feed my cat this morning?

As the scientists continue their work, the machine emits a low hum, growing steadily louder.

PLAYER
(noticing)
The energy levels are rising. Be prepared for any anomalies.

Suddenly, the machine begins to tremble and emit sparks. Panic ensues.

SCIENTIST 1
(frantically)
Something's not right! Shut it down!

SCIENTIST 2
(desperately)
Abort! Abort the experiment!

They scramble to turn off the machine, but their efforts are in vain.

A blinding flash engulfs the room as the antimatter machine implodes, releasing an intense burst of energy. The shockwave knocks the scientists off their feet.

As the dust settles, the room is in chaos. Debris litters the floor, and alarms blare in the distance.

PLAYER
(dazed)
What... what just happened?

Regaining composure, the PLAYER looks around, their eyes widening in horror.

PLAYER
(whispering)
No... they're gone.

The lifeless bodies of SCIENTIST 1, SCIENTIST 2, and SCIENTIST 3 lie motionless amidst the wreckage.

PLAYER
(filled with determination)
I'm the only one left. I have to find a way out... and survive.
